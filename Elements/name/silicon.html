    <div id="about">
        <h2>About Silicon</h2>
        <ul id="p">
            <li>Second-most abundant element in Earth's crust</li>
            <li>It is not found in its free state but as silica (silicon dioxide) in sand, quartz, and rocks.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="use">
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <ul id="p">
            <li>Highly purified silicon is used to make microchips, transistors, and other solid-state devices that are fundamental to computers and mobile phones. </li>
            <li>Silicon, often in the form of silica (SiOâ‚‚), is a key component in producing glass for windows, containers, and laboratory equipment. </li>
            <li>Silicon's semiconductor properties make it ideal for use in photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight into electricity. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="past">
        <h2>Silicon in Ancient India</h2>
        <ul id="p">
            <li>Ancient Indian texts like the Arthashastra discuss chemicals, and archeological findings show the use of silica as a flux in copper smelting and as the primary component in ancient glass. </li>
            <li>The Ayurvedic system, which dates back to the first millennium BC, utilizes silica in various ways, including as a substance to check for adulteration in medicines and for its potential health benefits related to lipid metabolism. </li>
        </ul>
